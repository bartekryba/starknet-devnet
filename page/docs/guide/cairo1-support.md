# Cairo 1 support

Declaring, deploying and interacting with Cairo 1 contracts is supported in the latest version of starknet-devnet. To successfully declare a contract compiled with Cairo v1.0.0-rc0, if on an x86 machine, you don't have to do anything. If on another architecture, or if you want to specify a custom version of the Cairo 1 compiler, you need to specify a local compiler for recompilation (a necessary step in the declaraion of Cairo 1 contracts). Use one of:

- `--cairo-compiler-manifest <PATH_TO_CARGO_TOML>`
- `--sierra-compiler-path <PATH_TO_SIERRA_EXECUTABLE>`

## Docker support

Devnet's Docker image has a recompiler set up internally, so Cairo 1 is supported out-of-the-box. But to use a custom compiler, you should have a statically linked executable binary sierra compiler on your host and use it like this (use absolute paths when mounting):

```
$ docker run -it \
    -p <YOUR_PORT>:5050 \
    --mount type=bind,source=<YOUR_PATH>,target=/starknet-sierra-compile \
    -it \
    shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<TAG> \
    --sierra-compiler-path /starknet-sierra-compile
```
